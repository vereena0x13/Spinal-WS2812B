  - the logic relating to "led strips" and "[tiled] led matrices"
    from the logic responsible for generating the WS2812B signal
    furthermore, the logic for looking up individual pixel component
    bytes in memory should also be decoupled
  - "frame interpolation" for the scrolling on the led strip
    - really we have no need to do this in hardware; for now we'll do
      it when generating the ROM for the strip
      but later, it might be kinda neat/fun to try
      implementing it in hardware?
